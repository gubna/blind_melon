                    And ain't it a pity

                <h3>"All That I Need"</h3>
                <p>All that I need is the air that I breathe
                    And all that I need are things I don't need
                    And all that really matters is what matters to me
                    And who of you are like me

                    If I was to smile and I held out my hand
                    If I opened it now would you not understand
                    Because you know if I'm to benefit I'll do everything that I can
                    And who of you are like me

                    It will make you feel good, over my shoulder
                    It'll get me down and got me tied up
                    'Till I grow older, but feel me inside of you
                    Like you want it to

                    But is it just the pains in your head
                    That are thrilling me
                    Another life's falling down onto it's knees
                    But I'll never smile the way, that I did like that day

                    Everything will be okay
                    It'll be okay </p>

                <h3>"Change"</h3>
                <p> I don't feel the suns comin' out today
                    its staying in, its gonna find another way.
                    As I sit here in this misery, I don't
                    think I'll ever see the sun from here.

                    And oh as I fade away,
                    they'll all look at me and say, and they'll say,
                    Hey look at him! I'll never live that way.
                    But that's okay
                    they're just afraid to change.

                    When you feel your life ain't worth living
                    you've got to stand up and
                    take a look around you then a look way up to the sky.
                    And when your deepest thoughts are broken,
                    keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die.

                    And as we all play parts of tomorrow,
                    some ways will work and other ways we'll play.
                    But I know we all can't stay here forever,
                    so I want to write my words on the face of today.
                    and then they'll paint it

                    And oh as I fade away,
                    they'll all look at me and they'll say,
                    Hey look at him and where he is these days.
                    When life is hard, you have to change. </p>
