      <h3>"Life Ain't So Shitty"</h3>
      <p>Life ain't so shitty
There's a lot that you can be
And ain't it a pity
But its alright to smile back at me
And if we both go there
We can count on problems that we might not necessarily
Come in contact with,
Hey wake up, do you know where I'm coming from

Life ain't so shitty
There's a lot that you can be
And ain't it a pity
But its alright to smile back at me
And if we both go there
We can count on problems that we might not necessarily
Come in contact with do you know where I'm coming from </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>"All That I Need"</h3>
      <p>All that I need is the air that I breathe
And all that I need are things I don't need
And all that really matters is what matters to me
And who of you are like me

If I was to smile and I held out my hand
If I opened it now would you not understand
Because you know if I'm to benefit I'll do everything that I can
And who of you are like me

It will make you feel good, over my shoulder
It'll get me down and got me tied up
'Till I grow older, but feel me inside of you
Like you want it to

But is it just the pains in your head
That are thrilling me
Another life's falling down onto it's knees
But I'll never smile the way, that I did like that day

Everything will be okay
It'll be okay </p>

      <h3>"Change"</h3>        
      <p> 	I don't feel the suns comin' out today
its staying in, its gonna find another way.
As I sit here in this misery, I don't
think I'll ever see the sun from here.

And oh as I fade away,
they'll all look at me and say, and they'll say,
Hey look at him! I'll never live that way.
But that's okay
they're just afraid to change.

When you feel your life ain't worth living
you've got to stand up and
take a look around you then a look way up to the sky.
And when your deepest thoughts are broken,
keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die.

And as we all play parts of tomorrow,
some ways will work and other ways we'll play.
But I know we all can't stay here forever,
so I want to write my words on the face of today.
and then they'll paint it

And oh as I fade away,
they'll all look at me and they'll say,
Hey look at him and where he is these days.
When life is hard, you have to change. </p>
